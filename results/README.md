This folder contains the plots and raw data used in the paper. The `*.pkl` files are pre-processed to contain only useful information for the plots; we provide Python scripts to create these pkl files from unprocessed data. These scripts can also be used to extract data from an experiment run. The plotting scripts are also included.
