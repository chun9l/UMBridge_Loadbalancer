This is the repository for the ISC paper "A Performance Analysis of UQ Workflows on HPC Systems"

We provide both the code and data for reproducibility. The code are located in two separate folders name `umbridge` and `slurm`, whereas the data are located in `results`. Each of these folders has their own README for instructions.

You can find our paper here: 

This repo is meant to be fairly self-contained. More information about UM-Bridge can be found in the main repo:
