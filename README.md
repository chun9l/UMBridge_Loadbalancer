This is the repository for the ISC paper "A Performance Analysis of UQ Workflows on HPC Systems". You can find our paper [here.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11018268)

We provide both the code and data for reproducibility. The code are located in two separate folders name `umbridge` and `slurm`, whereas the data are located in `results`. Each of these folders has their own README for instructions.

The pre-trained GP model is kindly provided by our collaborators at UKAEA. More information about this GP can be found in this [paper.](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0174478)

This repo is meant to be fairly self-contained. More information about UM-Bridge can be found in the main repo: <https://github.com/UM-Bridge/umbridge/tree/main>. Alternatively, feel free to email the corresponding author (Chung: chung.m.loi@durham.ac.uk) for any questions!
